Here i used hto automl for ensemble classification.

why hto?
    H2O.ai is the open source leader in AI and machine learning with a mission to democratize AI for everyone.
    HTO supports stackled ensmeble concepts which provides ensemble classification in a efficient way
    
I trained svm,rf and automl model from spectral123.csv and segregated vegetation,building and water area

i explained how code works in my code

i also attached video recording link as the  code runs long time i recorded few minutes before output came
